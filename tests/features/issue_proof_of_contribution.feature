Feature: Issue Proof of Contribution SBT for writers
    As the 1729 writers guild administrator
    So that the 1729 community can grow and the writers can be recognized for their work
    I want to issue Proof of Contribution Soulbound Token (SBT)s to contributors

    Scenario: Issue Proof of Contribution SBTs to writers for full participation

    Scenario: Issue Proof of Contribution SBTs to writers for partial participation

# TODO ensure funds are distributed to fully contributing writers
